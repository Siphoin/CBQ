  description: Has little health, but has 20% of the damage of any weapon, but it
    is better with a knife, then the damage will increase by 5%. Effective in stealth
    mode, there is a camouflage ability, which makes the player translucent, but
    still visible. Due to the increased damage, it is suitable for surprise attacks,
    but it is weak if it is attacked with massive damage or surrounded. Death is
    guaranteed in this case.
